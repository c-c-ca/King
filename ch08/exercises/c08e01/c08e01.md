`sizeof(a) / sizeof(t)` is inferior because it requires that the program be modified in two places if the type of the array is modified.

According to http://knking.com/books/c2/answers/c8.html:

The problem with sizeof(a) / sizeof(t) is that it can't easily be checked for correctness by someone reading the program. (The reader would have to locate the declaration of a and make sure that its elements have type t.)
