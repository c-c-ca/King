Including a system header with #include "file" may be problematic if
a header file of the same name exists in one of the places that the
compiler searches for before searching as if the name had been enclosed
in brackets.  Because the sequence of places in which the compiler
searches depends on whether quotations or brackets are used, compilation
may take more time if a system header file is not enclosed properly.
