(a)
Output if DEBUG is defined:
Value of i: 1
Value of j: 2
Value of k: 3
Value of i + j: 3
Value of 2 * i + j - k: 1

(b)
Output if DEBUG is not defined:

(c)
In part b, DEBUG is not defined, so PRINT_DEBUG(n) is defined as 1.  Any occurrence of the
PRINT_DEBUG(n) macro will be replaced by 1, so not output will be printed.

(d)
It is necessary, because the header file will be included in testdebug.c in the location
where the preprocessing directive appears.  If DEBUG is defined after debug.h is included,
the DEBUG macro will be undefined, resulting in the same behavior that occurs when DEBUG
is not defined anywhere in the testdebug.c.
