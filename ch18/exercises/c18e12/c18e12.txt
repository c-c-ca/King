(a)

f is a function that takes two arguments.  The first argument is a pointer to a
function that has a long argument and returns a float value.  The second argument is
a pointer to a char value.  f returns a pointer to a function that has a double
argument and returns an int value.

(b) 

int (*f(float (*)(long), char *))(double);
float (*g)(long);

int main(void) {
    int n;
    char *p;
    long int l;
    double x;
    ..
    n = (*f((*g)(l), p))(x);
