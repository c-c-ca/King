### (a)
The purpose of the `assert` statement is to allow for a program to monitor its own behavior and detect problems at an early stage, not test for conditions that are outside the control of the program.  The type of events that would fall into this second category more closely fit the description of an exceptional condition, otherwise known as a signal.

### (b)
Problems beyond the control of the program may arise as a result of a user interrupting or killing the program, a failed network connection, or invalid command line arguments.
