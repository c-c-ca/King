Because there is overlap between the sets of possible values from which bytes can be drawn in the Shift-JIS encoding, it is not the case that a byte within a valid multibyte character cannot represent another valid character.  For example, `\x40` is both a valid second byte in a two-byte sequence and a valid whole character.  That is, the interpretation of a byte (or sequence of bytes) may depend on the previously read byte.  This is in contrast to UTF-8, where each code point is represented by a unique sequence of bytes.
