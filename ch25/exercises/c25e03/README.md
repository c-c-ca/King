The Shift-JIS encoding does not have this property because the set of possible values for a valid second byte in a two-byte character and the set of possible values for a whole character are the same.  That is, the interpretation of a byte  (or sequence of bytes) may depend on the previously read byte.  This is in contrast to UTF-8, where each code point is represented by a unique sequence of bytes.
