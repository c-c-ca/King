The conversation specifications `%.4d` and `%04d` differ for negative integers consisting of 3 or less digits. The sign of an integer is included in the field width, while the precision for an integer only refers to the minimum number of digits, not the width of the field.  For example, if `i` is an `int` with a value of `-1`, then `%.4d` and `%04d` will produce `-0001` and `-001`, respectively.
